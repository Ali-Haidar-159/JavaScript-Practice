# JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains various JavaScript code snippets and mini-projects that I've developed as I learned the fundamentals and advanced concepts of JavaScript.

## Introduction

I have been learning JavaScript for a few weeks and have practiced coding various concepts like variables, functions, objects, arrays, loops, asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, and more. This repository includes my work and mini-projects to improve my skills and demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript.

### Topics Covered:
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Arrays and Objects
- Functions and Scope
- Conditional Statements (If-Else)
- Loops (For, While, For-Each)
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)
- Error Handling (Try-Catch)
- DOM Manipulation
- Browser Object Model (BOM)
- ES6 Features (Arrow Functions, Let/Const, Template Literals, Destructuring, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Web Storage (LocalStorage, SessionStorage)
- API Interaction (Fetch, Async/Await)

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML
- CSS (for styling some projects)
- APIs (for fetching and displaying data)



## How to Run

To view the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
